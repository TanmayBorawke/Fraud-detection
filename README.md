# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

A machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Python and scikit-learn.  
The model is trained on the **Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a significant challenge for financial institutions.  
This project aims to build a **classification model** that can detect fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.

We use:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Evaluation Metrics** like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

## 📂 Dataset

- Dataset: [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Description**:
  - Transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.
  - Contains `284,807` transactions, of which `492` are fraudulent.
  - Features are numerical due to PCA transformation.
- **Target Column**:  
  - `Class = 0` → Legitimate Transaction  
  - `Class = 1` → Fraudulent Transaction

📊 Model Training
Steps:

Load and preprocess the dataset.

Handle class imbalance using undersampling or SMOTE.

Train models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Evaluate performance using confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

📈 Results
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-score
Logistic Regression	99.2%	92%	85%	88%
Random Forest	99.9%	97%	91%	94%

(Results may vary depending on preprocessing and train-test split.)

📌 Important Notes
The creditcard.csv file is large (~150 MB).
Do not upload it directly to GitHub — use a .gitignore file to exclude it.
